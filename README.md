Assignment to Create Bootstrap-Enabled Portfolio

The goal of this project was to build upon the project assignment of the previous week which was a basic portfolio website. 

Instructions
-Inside the Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
-Find a Bootstrap theme (or make your one!). Some choices: Wrap Bootstrap, Boots Watch, Start Bootstrap, Theme Forest, Bootstrap Skins, Blacktie
-Install the Bootstrap theme and add to the portfolio content.
-Leave space for future projects.
- Create the index.php and composer.json inside Bootstrap-Portfolio
-Make sure you have <?php include_once("yourFileNameHere"); ?> and {} for those files.
-Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to Heroku. Remember: heroku login, heroku create, git push heroku master

Lessons Learned from this Project:
-I would have benefited from starting this project much earlier. This was part of a two piece project, and by the time I had finished the first part of the assignment, it was time to submit the assignment for review. 
-I learned a valuable lesson in time management, and in asking for help from my instructors and TA's  mcuh earlier in the process.
